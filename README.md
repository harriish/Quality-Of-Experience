User Devices : Android Mobile, iPad
Network connectivities : Broadband (Wi-Fi), 4G LTE
Experimental Design: To analyze the navigation service provided by both Android mobile(LG G7) and iPad devices, users travel in a same local bus of some finite distance and experimental set-up for a user is :
Devices : iPad, LG G7 
Network connectivities : Wi-Fi facility provided by local bus (Blekingetrafiken), Cellular data 4G (Halon)

To follow the study used for QoE, to describe what QoE features, factors have been used, to get the correlation to obtain its summary statistics and raw data.
